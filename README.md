# Microsoft Movie Analysis


Author: Allan Eshitera


## Project overview


Microsoft's intended entry into the movie industry is an opportunity to meet market demand and enrich customer engagement. 
Success relies on data-driven decisions to create compelling content and tap into this growing market effectively.
I was tasked to help Microsoft get insights into this venture by analysing the best studios, most popular movie genre and the
correlation between movie runtime and its popularity.


## Business problem


In the unpredictable film industry, data-driven decision-making is crucial. Unlike traditional investments, 
movie production can yield either substantial profits or significant losses. Statistical insights offer studios a competitive
edge, potentially the difference between success and bankruptcy.


## Key Findings


Genre Popularity: 'Drama' is the most popular genre, making it a prime choice for content creation.

Buena Vista's Success: Consider partnerships or acquisitions with successful studios like Buena Vista to
establish a strong presence in the film industry.

Runtime and Votes: The weak correlation between runtime and votes allows flexibility in content length.
Focusing on 'Drama' content aligns with audience preferences and allows for diversification.


## Conclusion


This analysis leads to the following conclusions for the types of films that are the best performing in the box office:
Genre Popularity: The analysis shows that the 'Drama' genre has the highest movie count, indicating its popularity among consumers. This information is valuable for content creators and studios
looking to produce content that resonates with a broad audience.
Buena Vista's Success: Buena Vista stands out as the studio with the highest total gross income. This finding suggests that Microsoft could explore partnerships, collaborations, or even consider
acquisitions in the film industry. Acquiring or partnering with successful studios like Buena Vista could be a strategic move to enter the film industry with a strong foothold.
Runtime and Votes: The weak correlation between the runtime of movies and the number of votes received provides flexibility for Microsoft. This indicates that Microsoft can produce content of
varying lengths, including short movies or long series. Since 'Drama' is the most popular genre, Microsoft can focus on producing drama content in line with audience preferences.



## Recommendation


Strategic Partnerships and Acquisitions: Consider strategic partnerships with successful studios and potentially explore acquisition opportunities in the film industry. Rationale: The analysis
identified Buena Vista as a top-performing studio. Partnering with or acquiring studios like Buena Vista can provide Microsoft with a competitive edge, established content libraries, and industry
expertise. This strategic move can expedite Microsoft's entry and growth in the film industry.
Content Production Strategy: Develop a content production strategy that caters to the most popular genre, 'Drama,' while also offering flexibility in content length. Rationale: 'Drama' is the most
popular genre, and the weak correlation between runtime and votes implies flexibility in content creation. Microsoft can focus on producing drama content to align with consumer preferences
while diversifying the portfolio with both short films and long series. This approach can maximize audience engagement and satisfaction.
Digital Distribution Platform: Create a digital distribution platform for movie content to reach a broader audience. Rationale: As a tech giant, Microsoft has the resources and technical capabilities
to develop a digital platform for distributing films. This platform can serve as a one-stop destination for streaming and purchasing movies, making it accessible to a global audience. By leveraging
Microsoft's technology expertise, this platform can provide a seamless and engaging viewing experience.
